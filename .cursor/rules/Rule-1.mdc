## Components

- Use function components for all React components.
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Use `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management and side effects.
- Use `useRouter` from `next/router` for navigation.
- Use `import { useContentStore } from '../store/contentStore';` to access the content store to display content.
- Break components into smaller, reusable parts.
- place components in the `components/` directory.

## Styles

- Use plain CSS files for styling.
- Use CSS modules for component-specific styles.
- Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for CSS classes.
- Avoid using inline styles; use CSS classes instead.
- place styles in the `styles/` directory.

## Refactoring

- Refactor components to be more modular and reusable.
- Extract common logic into custom hooks.
- Use utility functions for repeated logic.
- Avoid deep nesting of components; keep the component tree flat.
- Use `React.Fragment` to group elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
