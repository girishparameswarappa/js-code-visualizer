## Code Suggestions

- Use `const` for variables that do not change.
- Use `let` only when the variable needs to be reassigned.
- Use `async/await` for asynchronous operations.
- Use template literals for string concatenation.
- Reuse css classes instead of creating new ones for similar styles.
- Add css classes in their respective component css files if any new ones are added.
- Use arrow functions for concise function expressions.
- Use destructuring for props and state to improve readability.
- Creative and innovative solutions are encouraged, but they should be practical and maintainable.
- Avoid using third-party libraries unless absolutely necessary; prefer built-in features of React and Next.js.
